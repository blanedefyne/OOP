Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us

Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in
